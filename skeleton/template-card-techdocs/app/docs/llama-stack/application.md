## Application Information

The application created by this AI Software Template uses an existing `llama-stack` service.

This application relies on [Meta's python llama-stack package](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack) to simplify communication with the Model Service and uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the UI layer. This Chatbot takes conversational input from a user. Based on the input and data from previous conversations, the Chatbot formulates an appropriate response to the prompt.
